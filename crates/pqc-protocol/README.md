# pqc-rs-protocol

`pqc-rs-protocol` provides transport-independent protocol-layer foundations
for the PQC-rs ecosystem.

## Initial scope

The crate currently defines:

- client and server protocol roles;
- logical protocol directionality;
- protocol-family and capability identifiers;
- protocol-message identifiers and semantic classes;
- a transport-independent protocol-message trait;
- a generic message envelope with payload-type independence;
- non-allocating protocol encoding and prefix/exact decoding contracts;
- protocol-version identifiers;
- cryptographic-policy identifiers;
- opaque session identifiers;
- validated transport-independent session lifecycle states;
- a protocol-session metadata container with validated transitions;
- typestate session wrappers and bounded phase markers for compile-time lifecycle progression;
- fixed, independently versioned wire-header primitives and framing constants;
- protocol-layer error types.

It defines the semantic model, fixed shape, big-endian byte encoding, and
validation rules of the initial wire header. Complete message framing,
payload slicing, transport integration, and networking remain deferred.
